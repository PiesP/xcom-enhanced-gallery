Refactor: Remove performance monitoring feature from GalleryApp and related configurations

- Removed `performanceMonitoring` property from `GalleryConfig` and `AppConfig` interfaces.
- Cleaned up related code in `startApplication` function to eliminate performance timing logs.
- Updated `ToastContainer` to use typed `ToastItem` from the unified toast manager.
- Removed unused global selector statistics functions from `signal-selector`.
- Cleaned up unit tests by removing performance monitoring tests and debug mode checks.
