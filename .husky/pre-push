# Git Pre-Push Hook for X.com Enhanced Gallery
# =============================================================================
#
# This Git pre-push hook ensures code quality and stability by running
# comprehensive tests before allowing pushes to remote repositories.
# It prevents broken code from being pushed to shared branches.
#
# Hook workflow:
# 1. Test execution - Runs the full test suite to validate functionality
# 2. Exit on failure - Prevents push if any tests fail
#
# Requirements:
# - Node.js and npm must be installed
# - Test dependencies must be available
# - All tests must pass for push to succeed
#
# Usage:
# This hook is automatically triggered when running 'git push' command.
# To bypass this hook (not recommended): git push --no-verify
#
# Troubleshooting:
# - If tests fail, fix the issues before attempting to push again
# - Ensure all dependencies are installed with 'npm install'
# - Run 'npm run test' manually to debug test failures
#
# @see package.json - Test script configuration
# @see vitest.config.ts - Test runner configuration
