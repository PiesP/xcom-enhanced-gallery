# Pre-commit Hook for X.com Enhanced Gallery
# =============================================================================
#
# This Git pre-commit hook ensures code quality by running automated checks
# before allowing commits to be created. It prevents commits that fail
# quality standards from being added to the repository.
#
# Hook workflow:
# 1. Type checking - Validates TypeScript types across the project
# 2. Lint staged files - Runs ESLint on files staged for commit
#
# If any step fails, the commit is rejected and must be fixed before retry.
#
# @see https://typicode.github.io/husky/ - Husky documentation
# @see https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged - lint-staged documentation

# TypeScript Type Checking
# =============================================================================
# Validates TypeScript types across the entire project to catch type errors
# before they are committed. This ensures type safety and prevents runtime
# errors caused by type mismatches.
#
# Command: npm run typecheck
# - Runs TypeScript compiler in check mode (no output files)
# - Validates all .ts/.tsx files according to tsconfig.json
# - Exits with error code if any type errors are found
echo "üìã Type checking..."
npm run typecheck || exit 1

# =============================================================================
# Lint Staged Files
# =============================================================================
# Runs ESLint only on files that are staged for commit, improving performance
# by avoiding unnecessary linting of unchanged files.
#
# Command: npx lint-staged
# - Configured via .lintstagedrc.json or package.json
# - Applies ESLint rules and auto-fixes when possible
# - Runs Prettier for code formatting
# - Only processes files matching configured patterns
#
# Benefits:
# - Faster execution (only staged files)
# - Consistent code style across commits
# - Early detection of linting issues
