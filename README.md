## 🛠️ Technical Features

### Architecture

- **3-Layer Architecture**: Features → Shared → External modular structure
- **Type Safety**: Complete type safety guaranteed with TypeScript
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading and efficient memory management
- **Isolated Rendering**: Independent UI that doesn't affect X.com's original
  styles

### Core Technologies

- **UI Framework**: Solid.js 1.9.9 - Reactive UI, high performance
- **State Management**: Solid.js Signals - Fine-grained reactive state
- **Compression**: fflate - High-performance ZIP compression library
- **Styling**: CSS Modules + design token system

### Icon System

- **Icon Library**: Heroicons (React) components used safely via "vendor getter"
  pattern.
  - Application code only uses getters from `@shared/external/vendors`, never
    directly imports external libraries.
  - `@heroicons/react` components are safely converted from React Elements →
    Solid VNodes inside getters.
  - UI renders via semantic-named adapters (e.g., `HeroDownload` → `Download`)
    using consistent `Icon` wrapper.

### Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Version | Status |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| Chrome  | 88+     | ✅     |
| Firefox | 78+     | ✅     |
| Safari  | 14+     | ✅     |

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/PiesP/xcom-enhanced-gallery.git
cd xcom-enhanced-gallery

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Test
npm test
```

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions intentionally keeps CI lean:

- `ci.yml` installs dependencies, performs a production build via `npx vite build --mode production`, uploads the artifact, and then runs a separate CodeQL job.
- `release.yml` only bumps versions when manually triggered, runs `npm ci`, executes `npx vite build` in development and production modes, and uploads the packaged release.

No lint/test/npm script automation runs inside CI or release workflows, so always execute `npm run quality:full`, `npm run test:unit:batched`, and related commands locally before pushing or invoking the release workflow.

Security hardening runs separately via `security.yml`:

- Weekly + on-demand `npm audit` (moderate/high) with artifacts for traceability.
- `npm run security:gh-scan` (GH CLI) blocks builds when GitHub reports open Dependabot, Code Scanning, or Secret Scanning alerts.
  - The script writes a structured summary to standard output so CI logs immediately show the alert kind, counts, severities, and representative samples.
- Official CodeQL analysis uploads SARIF results to the repository Security tab for long-term tracking.
  - Locally the gate logs warnings; set `XEG_ENFORCE_GH_SECURITY_SCAN=1` to turn alerts into hard failures (security.yml does this automatically).

### Quality Profiles

Use `npm run quality:*` to execute the centralized guard suite before builds:

- `quality:prebuild` runs tokens, typecheck, ESLint, Stylelint, dependency cruiser, and the relative import guard.
- `quality:validate` mirrors the prebuild profile for local workflows.
- `quality:full` adds the style-import guard; run it locally (CI never runs this profile) and it will auto-skip when no CSS changed.

Each command writes `test-results/quality-suite-summary.json`, making it easy to see which guard failed during `npm run build` or PR validation.
